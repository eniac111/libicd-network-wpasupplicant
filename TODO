wpa-supplicant conversion task list:

[ ] Rename package to libicd-network-wpasupplicant (from libicd-network-wlan)
[/] Implement scanning
[/] Implement network info getting
[ ] Implement other icd2 interfaces
[ ] Figure out how wpa_supplicant should be started
[ ] Look at wpa_priv(8)

[ ] Test mode complicated network setups (eduroam, ad-hoc...)
