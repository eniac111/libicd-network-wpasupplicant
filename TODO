wpa-supplicant conversion task list:

[/] Rename package to libicd-network-wpasupplicant (from libicd-network-wlan) [in separate branch, needs fixes]
[X] Implement scanning
[X] Implement network info getting
[X] Implement network adding / connecting
[/] Implement other icd2 interfaces
[ ] Rework g variant parsing using more complex g_variant_get calls
[X] Implement wlan_statistics
[/] Add states
[ ] Look at auth failures and timeouts
[ ] Figure out how wpa_supplicant should be started
[ ] Look at wpa_priv(8)
[/] Run valgrind over code
[ ] Test more complicated network setups (eduroam, ad-hoc...)
[ ] Active or passive scan?
[ ] Properly (re)add copyright where code was used/copied from previous module

[X] Re-add gconf support
[X] Make plugin work with gconf values
[X] Support loading values from gconf
[X] Be able to make wpasupplicant network configs from gconf
[/] Add network attrs and local attrs (local attrs can be passed to icd2, which are all wpa_supplicant attrs possible, but then stored in the local-attr part... I guess)

[ ] Refactor code: rename functions, macros, etc, make it a lot more clean

[X] `network_name` should be connection name, if known in gconf

[/] Implement network down notifications (lost connection, etc) - requires to keep network_id and such in struct
[ ] Run `linux -indent` on all code to fix mixed spaces/tabs, retroactively through the commits.
[X] Do not crash on auto scan



Mappings:

- gconf network desc (NOTE: gconf doesn't contain just network properties, but
  also some policies, but place them elsewhere)
- wpa_supplicant bss desc (dbus in)
- wpa_supplicant add_network desc (dbus out)

Mappings alwaus way, apart from name:
  - gconf -> dbus out (wpa_supplicant add_network)
  - dbus in -> dbus out

Matching:

- 'gconf known' networks to 'dbus in' networks (I would say: gconf -> IR, dbus
  in -> IR, match IR networks...?)
